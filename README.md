# Professional C++ Bank Account Application

This is a professional C++ application for managing bank accounts and transactions.

## Features

- **Account Management**: Allows users to deposit, withdraw, transfer funds, and request loans.
- **Transaction History**: Maintains a transaction history with details of each transaction.
- **Security Measures**: Implements user authentication, account freezing, and locking features.
- **Loan Management**: Provides functionality for requesting, repaying, and applying interest to loans.
- **Currency Support**: Supports multiple currencies for deposits, withdrawals, and transfers.

## Technologies Used

- **C++**: The application is written in C++.
- **Standard Library**: Utilizes various features of the C++ Standard Library for data structures, date and time handling, and input/output operations.
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Utilizes object-oriented principles for designing classes and managing bank accounts and transactions.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following main files:

- `main.cpp`: This is the main C++ file containing the `main()` function and the implementation of the BankAccount and Transaction classes.
- `Transaction.h` and `Transaction.cpp`: These files contain the declaration and implementation of the Transaction class.
- `BankAccount.h` and `BankAccount.cpp`: These files contain the declaration and implementation of the BankAccount class.
